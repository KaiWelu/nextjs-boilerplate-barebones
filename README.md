## About

This is a barebones template for NextJS projects. It contains the things I consider as absolute base (for now) for every further project. Includes tailwindcss for styling and playwright + vitest for testing purposes.

## Tech used

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
-   [Tailwind x Prettier](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
-   [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation)

## How to use

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
